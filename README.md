# The Gang Picks an Episode

A React app built to provide users with a tool to pick a random episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia based on some simple filters, as well as provide interesting data about each episode.

### Using

#### Random episodes

Select random episodes by applying filters from the controls in the web app.

#### Sharing episodes

You can select specific episodes by visiting the unique URL for the episode, or by searching for the episode.

For instance, the url `https://thegangpicksanepisode.com/7/10` will direct you to Season **7** episode **10**: "How Mac Got Fat." This allows you to easily share links to the specific episode with your friends!

### Contributing

I love contributions of any kind! Just open an Issue or PR to discuss what you'd like to - even if its just a feature request that you'd like me to code up. All ideas are welcome :)
